
The below solution i have writen in Oracle SQL due to GCP account got expire.

Write a query to pull back the most recent redemption count, by redemption date, for the date
range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store". Your result should have 2 columns
and 7 rows (one row per day in the date range). Provide the query and then using your query
result, provide answers to the following questions.


create table helper_table as (
select cte2.redemptionDate,cte2.redemptionCount from 
    (select * from tblRedemptionsByDay 
	      where createDateTime >= to_timestamp('2023-10-30','YYYY-MM-DD') 
					and 
		       createDateTime <=to_timestamp('2023-11-06','YYYY-MM-DD')) cte2  
    inner join (
	   select id,RETAILERNAME from tblRetailers where retailerName ='ABC Store') cte
on cte2.retailerId = cte.id
    )
select * from helper_table

Explanation
===========

I have store the 7 days of data in helper_table that i will use to derive the below questions.


1. Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?

select * from helper_table where redemptionCount= (select min(redemptionCount)  from helper_table)

2. Which date had the most number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
select * from helper_table where redemptionCount= (select max(redemptionCount)  from helper_table)

3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?

select REDEMPTIONDATE,REDEMPTIONCOUNT,CREATEDATETIME from tblRedemptionsByDay where REDEMPTIONCOUNT in (select REDEMPTIONCOUNT from (
select REDEMPTIONDATE,REDEMPTIONCOUNT from helper_table where redemptionCount= (select min(redemptionCount)  from helper_table)
union
select REDEMPTIONDATE,REDEMPTIONCOUNT from helper_table where redemptionCount= (select max(redemptionCount)  from helper_table)
))

Explanation
===========
I have union the solution 1 and solution 2 then am comparing the REDEMPTIONCOUNT.

4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).

Solution
========
Above i have wrote the solution using subquery the other approch i can use is to write as a CTE so its more readable and we can reuse also.
